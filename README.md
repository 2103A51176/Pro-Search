# Pro-Search

**Pro-Search** is an Android application that allows users to efficiently search for keywords across multiple PDF, Word, and Excel documents. The app simplifies searching for content within various document formats by consolidating results in one place, saving time and effort.

## Project Overview

Pro-Search was inspired by the need to quickly find answers during open-book exams. In situations where internet access wasn't available, manually searching through each document for specific information was inefficient. Pro-Search enables users to select multiple documents in various formats and search through them simultaneously.

## Features

- Select and search across multiple PDFs, Word documents, and Excel files.
- Add or remove files dynamically before performing a search.
